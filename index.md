# About Me

<p style="text-align: justify"> I have completed my PhD in Computational Biology from University of Bergen. For my PhD thesis I explored various machine learning approaches for the genetic analysis of high-dimensional phenotypic data. I also used random forests to find the associations between brain imaging data and the genetic variants. Before my PhD, I completed my MS in computer engineering from Chosun University, South Korea. During my MS, I developed an improved majority filtering algorithm for the detection of mislabelled examples using support vector machines (SVMs). I also proposed a deep learning based patchwise UNet architecture for automatic segmentation of brain MRIs. My interests include machine/deep learning and data science in general.
